    <h2>A little bit of context</h2>
    <p>So, torta fritas (fried cakes) are actually not cakes at all, they're super simple, super filling, you know; food
        for the
        worker class.
        They were mainly consumed by gauchos (People that would make american cowboys look like little girls) as they
        had to face
        the harsh climate and remoteness of the pampas. Nowadays tho, torta fritas are a rioplatence staple, we commonly
        eat
        them during a rainy winter day alongside mate (the drink) and people you love. They're not just food for the
        body, but for
        the soul as well.
    </p>
    <p>Torta fritas are surprisingly delicious considering they're made from just 5 cheap ingredients. Although making
        them
        can become kind of a mess.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams (17 oz. or 2 cups) of wheat flour (Whole purpose or bread flour).</li>
        <li>250 ml (8.5 oz. or 1 cup) of warm water.</li>
        <li>20 grams (1.5 tbsp) of beef tallow for the dough.</li>
        <li>10 grams (1.5 tsp) of salt.</li>
        <li>5 grams (1 tsp) of sugar.</li>
        <li>10 grams (2 tsp) of fresh yeast.</li>
        <li>Enough beef tallow to completely submerge the torta fritas when frying.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Making the Dough:</h3>
    <p>Start with a wooden, plastic or glass bowl (avoid metal) big enough to fit the raised dough, add half of the warm
        water, add the salt,
        the sugar and the tablespoon of beef tallow, mix everything thoroughly, once the beef tallow is all melted, add
        the fresh yeast and be careful with the
        temperature of the water, it should be warm enough so when you sink your finger in it, you kinda don't feel
        anything. If it's too hot, it will kill the yeast.
    </p>
    <p>Once the yeast is dissolved, start adding the flour little by litte, always leave a little bit of flour for
        kneading and such.
        Now it's similar to making a pizza dough, the more you knead, the tastier it will be. Always use your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Continue adding flour as needed until the dough doesn't stick to the bowl, transfer it to a countertop or flat
        surface, as always, wood is
        prefered.
        Now start being aggresive with the dough, use your palms and try to add air into the dough, do so until you have
        a smooth, fluffy and homogeneous dough. Once you feel the dough is ready, put it back into the bowl and let it
        raise, cover the bowl with a wet linen or cotton dishcloth.
    </p>
    <p>When the dough doubles in size, divide it into equal parts, usually for 500 grams I end up making 4 to 5 torta
        fritas but it depends on how large your frying pan or pot is. Make buns with those individual parts and let them
        rest in your countertop, add a little bit of flour so they don't stick and cover them with the same wet
        dishcloth.
    </p>

    <h3>Frying:</h3>
    <p>While the buns rest, add the beef tallow to a frying pan although I recommend using a stockpot cause frying
        it's a messy business, you can also fry them in vegetable oil, but that's what Argentinians use because the city
        life has made them big pussies. Also beef tallow while fatter is also healthier than processed vegetable oil.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before getting the beef tallow ready for frying, place something like chinese chopsticks on top of a bowl, this
        is
        where you will hang the torta fritas once ready, so the excess grease can drain.
        Bring the beef tallow to around 180°C (356°F), if you can't measure the temperature, just use a little bit of
        dough and if it becomes bubbly and floats, then it's ready, you should not see smoke or vapor coming from the
        beef tallow. If you
        do, lower the flame (or voltage), if you end up with torta fritas soaking in grease it's because the beef tallow
        was too cold.
    </p>
    <p>So, once the beef tallow is ready for frying, grab one of the buns and strech it using a rolling pin,
        now, you can make them either think or thin acccording to your liking, thinner torta fritas are a lot more
        crunchy while
        thicker are a lot more spongy and chewy. <span style="color:darkred">Important!: Add a whole in the middle of
            the torta frita so it doesn't get bloated during frying and potentially explode.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Fry them as you would fry potato chips, once you see the edges of the torta frita start to get golden brown, flip
        it. Takes no more than a pair of minutes per side, once ready,
    </p>
    <p>Repeat the process with the rest of the torta fritas and Voila! Enjoy them with a nice coffee or if you want the
        true rioplatence experience, you can spread some dulce de leche or even sugar on them, also try drinking some
        mate, or mate cocido.
    </p>
    <p><em>Pro Gaucho tip:</em> When the beef tallow solidifies, you can scrap the bottom of it where most of the chunks
        will be, that way you can reuse the same beef tallow multiple times, in every Uruguayan house there is a pot
        dedicated to frying torta fritas filled with 10 years old beef tallow, usually it's an old pot that belonged to
        your grand-grandpa or something like that.
