    <figcaption>Not my actual pizza. Mine's way better.</figcaption>
    <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Gabriel, and while I'm not from Italy, I do make a mean pizza!
        I think even an italian maestro della pizza would approve.</p>
    <p>Contrary to what most people think, making pizza it's actually pretty cheap and easy! But! You have to follow the
        rules
        of making pizza. The most important thing isn't technique nor experience, it's actually tomatoes !! Really good
        tomatoes (and a good oven).
        <em>This recipe is for two pizzas.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Let's start with the dough</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams (2 cup. or. 17 2/3 oz.) of bread flour.</li>
        <li>10 grams (0.35 oz.) of fresh yeast.</li>
        <li>No more than 2 tea spoons of salt</li>
        <li>Around 200ml (5/6 cup) of water (could be more, could be less).</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of malt extract. <em>*optional</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Making the dough:</h3>
    <p>In a big bowl (wood is ideal, plastic or glass is ok, avoid metal), add the water, using your hand dissolve the
        salt
        and the malt extract.</p>
    <p>Once everything is well mixed, add the yeast in crumbles and dissolve it using your fingers.</p>
    <p>Start adding the flour little by little making sure you don't have lumps before adding more flour. Always use
        your hands
        as it will provide the live yeast with the warmth needed to activate. Remember the dough is a living organism,
        so
        treat it with care.
    </p>
    <p>After adding most of the flour (leave a little bit for the keading) the dough should now smell nice, kinda sweet.
        So now
        you start the kneading process, you can do so in the bowl or transfer the dough to a solid table or countertop
        (wood is prefered)
        the idea is to active the glutten and we do so by employing energy, you can slap, hit, pounch and
        even scream at the dough, do so for about 5 minutes, once the dough doesn't stick to the surface you're working
        on. It's time to
        prepare it for leaven.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to have a nice leaven, it's important to give the dough a strong outer layer, so you should try to form
        a nice and round bun,
        there are many techniques to do it (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJiucv88flM' target="_blank"
            rel='noreferrer noopener'>like this one</a>).
        Once you have a nice and round bun. Place it in the same bowl you used before and grab a cotton or linen
        dishcloth, wet it a little bit and place it over the dough,
        now close the bowl and leaven for 1 hour (if it's cold, leave it for more).
    </p>
    <p>After at least one hour, take your dough from the bowl, use your fingers to degasify it and place it in the same
        bowl again for at least 2 hours (or until the dough doubles in size). </p>
    <p>Once the dough doubles in size, cut it in two equal pieces, then oil a round roasting pan and using your fingers,
        strecht the dough so it fits neatly on each roasting pan.</p>
    <p>Leave them to rest while we make the sauce and toppings.</p>
    <h2>Sauce & Toppings</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong></li>
        <li>2 good perita tomatoes.</li>
        <li>1/4 of an onion.</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp of sugar.</li>
        <li>A pinch of white pepper.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste.</li>
        <li>30 ml (2 tbsp) of olive oil.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li><strong>For the toppings:</strong></li>
        <li>200 grams (1/2 oz) of mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Black olives (unpitted).</li>
        <li>Parmigiano cheese. <em>*optional</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Making the Sauce:</h3>
    <p>Before we make the souce, start by pre-heating the oven at the highest setting. Now for the sauce, it's actually
        pretty simple,
        first we need to peel the tomatoes, so you start by boiling enough water to completely cover
        the two tomatoes, once the water is boiling, add the two tomatoes and let them boil for no more than 5 minutes
        or until the peel breaks,
        then removes the tomatoes and rinse them with cold water. You'll see how the peel separates from the pulp.
        Removing the peel should be like removing a band aid.
    </p>
    <p>Now with the two tomatoes peeled, start crushing them with your bare hands, it's important to crush the tomatoes
        with your hands
        so you don't break the seeds which will add an unwanted flavor. You'll have to crush them until you have a
        paste,
        slice the onion quarter into little cubes and add them to the paste, now add the salt, sugar, white pepper and
        olive oil. That's it!
    </p>
    <h2>Cooking the pizza</h2>
    <p><em>Important!: every oven is different, I use an electric convection oven at the highest setting and both
            the upper and lower elements with the fan option turned on. </em></p>
    <p>Once the oven is well heated, grab one of the pizzas, add a little sauce but leave the rim unsauced, this is
        called the
        <em>cornicione</em> (don't soak the dough!) and put the pizza in the
        lower side of the oven until it starts to get golden brown, then take it out, add more sauce and the toppings
        starting with the
        olives, the mozzarella and then the parmigiano. Don't add the Basil just yet!
    </p>
    <p>Cook the pizza until the mozzarella cheese starts to get bubbly, you want to avoid the muzzarella from getting
        brown,
        usually it takes 10 minutes top.
    </p>
    <p>While it cooks, prepate a wooden board for serving by sparcing a little bit of flour on top,
        that way the pizza doesn't get soggy.
    </p>
    <p>Once the pizza is ready, you can now decorate your pizza with the basil leaves and some olive oil, also if you
        fell short
        of salt, you can use parmigiano. Always serve your pizza with white pepper and oregano for your guests'
        preferences.
    </p>
    <p>That's it bro! (or sis) While you're blowing everyone's minds with your tremendous pizza, you can start cooking
        the second one by repeating the process.
