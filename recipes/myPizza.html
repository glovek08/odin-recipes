    <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Gabriel, and while I'm not from Italy, I do make a mean pizza!
         I think even an italian maestro della pizza would approve.</p>
    <p>Contrary to what most people think, making pizza it's actually pretty cheap and easy! But! You have to follow the rules
        of making pizza. The most important thing isn't technique nor experience, it's actually tomatoes !! Really good
        tomatoes (and a good oven).
        <em>This recipe is for two pizzas.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Let's start with the dough</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams (2 cup. or. 17 2/3 oz.) of bread flour.</li>
        <li>10 grams (0.35 oz.) of fresh yeast.</li>
        <li>No more than 2 tea spoons of salt</li>
        <li>Around 200ml (5/6 cup) of water (could be more, could be less).</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of malt extract. <em>*optional</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Making the dough:</h3>
    <p>In a big bowl (wood is ideal, plastic or glass is ok, avoid metal), add the water, using your hand dissolve the salt 
        and the malt extract.</p>
    <p>Once everything is well mixed, add the yeast in crumbles and dissolve it using your fingers.</p>
    <p>Start adding the flour little by little making sure you don't have lumps before adding more flour. Always use your hands
        as it will provide the live yeast with the warmth needed to activate. Remember the dough is a living organism, so 
        treat it with care.
    </p>
    <p>After adding most of the flour (leave a little bit for the keading) the dough should now smell nice, kinda sweet. So now 
        you start the kneading process, you can do so in the bowl or transfer the dough to a solid table or countertop (wood is prefered)
        the idea is to active the glutten and we do so by employing energy, you can slap, hit, pounch and 
        even scream at the dough, do so for about 5 minutes, once the dough doesn't stick to the surface you're working on. It's time to
        prepare it for leaven.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to have a nice leaven, it's important to give the dough a strong outer layer, so you should try to form a nice and round bun,
        there are many techniques to do it (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJiucv88flM' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer noopener'>like this one</a>).
        Once you have a nice and round bun. Place it in the same bowl you used before and grab a cotton or linen dishcloth, wet it a little bit and place it over the dough,
        now close the bowl and leaven for 1 hour (if it's cold, leave it for more).
    </p>
    <p>After at least one hour, take your dough from the bowl, use your fingers to degasify it and place it in the same bowl again for at least 2 hours (or until the dough doubles in size). </p>
